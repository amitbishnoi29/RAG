# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. The algorithm learns from input-output pairs and can then make predictions on new, unseen data.

**Common algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

**Applications:**
- Email spam detection
- Image classification
- Medical diagnosis
- Stock price prediction

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. The algorithm must discover structure in the data on its own.

**Common algorithms:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Association Rules

**Applications:**
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems
- Data compression

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

**Key concepts:**
- Agent: The learner or decision maker
- Environment: The world the agent interacts with
- Actions: Choices available to the agent
- Rewards: Feedback from the environment

**Applications:**
- Game playing (Chess, Go, Video games)
- Robotics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Trading algorithms

## Machine Learning Process

### 1. Data Collection
Gathering relevant data for the problem you want to solve. This might include:
- Structured data (databases, spreadsheets)
- Unstructured data (text, images, audio)
- Real-time data streams

### 2. Data Preprocessing
Cleaning and preparing data for analysis:
- Handling missing values
- Removing outliers
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Feature engineering
- Data splitting (train/validation/test)

### 3. Model Selection
Choosing appropriate algorithms based on:
- Problem type (classification, regression, clustering)
- Data size and complexity
- Interpretability requirements
- Performance requirements

### 4. Training
The process of teaching the algorithm using training data:
- Feeding data to the algorithm
- Adjusting model parameters
- Optimizing performance metrics
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation

### 5. Evaluation
Assessing model performance using various metrics:

**Classification metrics:**
- Accuracy
- Precision and Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC

**Regression metrics:**
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared

### 6. Deployment
Putting the trained model into production:
- Model serving infrastructure
- API endpoints
- Monitoring and maintenance
- Model versioning
